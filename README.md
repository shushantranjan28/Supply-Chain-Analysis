# Supply Chain Data Analysis and Visualization

In this project, I conducted an extensive data analysis and visualization of a supply chain dataset using Python and various data visualization libraries such as Pandas, Plotly Express, and Plotly Graph Objects. The dataset contains information related to different products, their sales, revenue, stock levels, manufacturing details, transportation modes, and costs.

## Introduction

In this project, we aim to analyze and visualize supply chain data to gain valuable insights into product performance, sales, revenue, and other key metrics. The project utilizes Python and popular data visualization libraries to create interactive and informative visualizations.

## Dataset Overview

The dataset used in this project contains information on various aspects of the supply chain, including product types, SKUs, prices, availability, sales, revenue, customer demographics, stock levels, lead times, transportation modes, and costs.

## Project Description

The main objective of this project is to analyze the supply chain dataset and provide meaningful visualizations that help in understanding the following aspects:

- Relationship between product prices and generated revenue, colored by product type.
- Sales distribution by product type through a pie chart.
- Total revenue generated by each shipping carrier using a bar chart.
- Average lead time and manufacturing costs for different product types presented in a line chart.
- Revenue generated and stock levels for each SKU visualized with line charts.
- Order quantities for each SKU shown through a bar chart.
- Shipping costs for each shipping carrier illustrated with a bar chart.
- Cost distribution by different transportation modes depicted using a pie chart.
- Average defect rates for each product type represented with a bar chart.
- Average defect rates by transportation modes displayed through a pie chart.

## Technologies Used

The project was implemented using the following technologies and libraries:

- Python
- Pandas
- Plotly Express
- Plotly Graph Objects
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
